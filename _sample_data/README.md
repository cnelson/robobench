This is sample data captured with a GoPro HERO4 Silver in various lighting conditions.

Due to the size of the sample data (~ 3GB), it is not housed in this repo, but is available for download at 
[http://cnelson.org/~cnelson/robobench/_sample_data/](http://cnelson.org/~cnelson/robobench/_sample_data/)

There are three samples in folders named sample1, sample2, and sample3.  
See the README file in each folder for additional info specific to that sample.

The _sample_output folder containers the output of the car_segmentation program when run on 
these samples with the recommend crop settings.

Each .zip file contains the contents of each folder for easy downloading.
